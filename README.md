# Prototype

*Demo MCProtocolLib proxy for 1.19*

</div>

# Notice

This project is extremely incomplete and not exactly functional. I just ran out of time to focus on it so I'm dumping the code here.

A lot of this code, especially in the `net` package, is original source code from my old [ttRMS project](https://github.com/ttRMS). The main ttRMS codebase **will remain closed source** but I have pubished a lot of helper libraries on our org.

I haven't done much protocol work for 1.19 so it's quite unfamiliar to me. I'll try to help where I can, but I can't make promises.

## Q: Can I use this for my project?

A: bsolutely! Give the project a fork, I'd love to see what people can make, if they can figure out how to get it to work.

Licensed under ISC, pretty simple.
